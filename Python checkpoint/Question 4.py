# Given a non-empty string and an integral n, return a new string where the
# char at index n has been removed. The value of n will be a valid index of
# a char in the original string (i.e. n will be in the range 0..len(str)-1 inclusive). 

# missing_char('kitten', 1) â†’ 'ktten'    for example here we remove "i" which is located in the index 1

# missing_char('kitten', 0) â†’ 'itten'   here we remove "k" which is in the index 0

# missing_char('kitten', 4) â†’ 'kittn'   here we remove "e" which is in the index 4
